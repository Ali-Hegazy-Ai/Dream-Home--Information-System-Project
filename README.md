# is-project

## Project overview
This project was created by me and my team during our college **Information Systems** course. It was built solely to showcase the HTML and CSS skills we learned in class, and it is **not** intended to be a fully functional or production-ready website.

## Purpose and scope
- Static front-end demo highlighting layout, styling, and responsive structure
- No backend, database, or real data integrations
- Pages and forms are for presentation only and are not connected to live services

## Tech stack
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting started
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the homepage.
3. Use the navigation links to visit the other static pages.

## Project structure
- `index.html` – main landing page
- `contact.html` – contact form layout
- `login.html` – login page layout
- `sign-up.html` – registration page layout
- `styles.css` / `style.css` – styling for the pages
- `images/` – local image assets used across the pages

## Notes
This repository is intentionally kept simple to reflect the learning objectives of our coursework. If you are reviewing this project, please treat it as a visual showcase rather than a complete web application.
